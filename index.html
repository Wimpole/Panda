				The name "giant panda" is sometimes used to distinguish it from the red panda. Though it belongs to the order <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carnivora">Carnivora</a>, the giant panda is a <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Folivore">folivore</a>, with bamboo shoots and leaves making up more than 99% of its diet.[6]

				Giant pandas in the wild will occasionally eat other grasses, wild tubers, or even meat in the form of birds, rodents, or carrion.

				<h2>Reproduction</h2>

				<p>
					Initially, the primary method of breeding giant pandas in captivity was by artificial insemination, as they seemed to lose their interest in mating once they were captured.[78] This led some scientists to try extreme methods, such as showing them videos of giant pandas mating[79] and giving the males sildenafil (commonly known by name Viagra).[80]
				</p>

				<p>
					 Only recently have researchers started having success with captive breeding programs, and they have now determined giant pandas have comparable breeding to some populations of the American black bear, a thriving bear species. The normal reproductive rate is considered to be one young every two years.[15][68]
